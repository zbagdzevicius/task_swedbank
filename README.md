# task_swedbank
Task

Use your knowledge of semantic HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript, preferably some

Javascript derived frameworks, to create an interactive form with multiple steps

for whichever Swedbank product you choose (i.e. https://goo.gl/ZoerS5 or

https://goo.gl/uKjs7U).

 

Requirements

1. The form must contain an intro window, at least four steps and a summary.

2. Only one step must be visible at one time.

3. Every question is mandatory, no skipping!

4. You should be able to come back to the previous step.

5. At least one question should depend on the answer to a previous question.

6. Some kind of error messages should be shown.

7. The summary should contain the answers to all questions (don‘t need to save

data anywhere).

8. The design must be responsive – it will be tested on a mobile device (iPhone

5) and a desktop browser (FullHD screen).

9. The end result should be archived (name_surname.zip) or put in any public

repository of your choice (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc.)

10. The form should work when accessing index.html through a browser.

11. If you use some kind of build tools, write a README file how to launch the

form.

Bonus: unit tests.
